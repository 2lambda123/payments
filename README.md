# Unicorn Finance Client Code

This code takes data from our server and displays it in a user friendly manner for users.
We have built this codebase using React and Tailwind CSS.

The code is grouped by common components and pages. We have orchestrated it this way because we currently have pages that are independent from eachother. 

## Running frontend locally 

If you wish to run the backend as well please refer to the root readme in this project. Otherwise...

    cd client
    yarn install
    yarn start
