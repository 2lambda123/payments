# Demo Wholesale Payments App

Our goal is to create re-usable sample apps that external developer can leverage
as reference.

## Project structure

The codebase is built with React and Tailwind css on the frontend and express on the backend. 

## Running Locally

You need to start the frontend and backend. It will use mock data for running locally. 

### Backend
    
    yarn install
    yarn start

### Frontend

    cd client
    yarn install
    yarn start

Navigate to localhost:3000

### Deprecation warnings

These are coming from react scripts package, with open issue:
