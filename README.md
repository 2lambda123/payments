# Demo Wholesale Payments App

Our goal is to create re-usable sample apps that external developers can leverage
as reference.

## Project structure

The codebase is built with React and Tailwind css on the frontend and express on the backend. 

We have also implemented testing with Jest and Cypress. 

## Running Locally
You have the option of running locally with mocked data or hitting the actual APIs. 

### Mocked data

    yarn run dev

### Hitting API

    yarn run prod

Navigate to localhost:3000

## Running tests

    yarn run test


### Deprecation warnings

These are coming from react scripts package, with open issue:
